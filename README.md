Stellaris library for OneWire devices

This library brings OneWire support to Stellaris devices, in the form of an easy-to-interface C++ library. 

The controller class is easy to extend into different device handler classes, for controlling various OneWire devices. Included in this library are several devices that I have worked with, and include enough documentation to help with constructing any additional devices that may be required.

If you write a class descriptor for a device not included, please submit a pull request with your object! I will add it to the library attributed to you.
